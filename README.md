# dokuwiki-plugin-navbox
This plugin enables the ability to have a 'navbox' of related articles similar to the way Wikipedia does on some pages.

### Note: this does not currently work, it will be updated as it progresses

The DokuWiki Home Page will be https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:navbox however there is currently no data on there.

If you think you may know what is wrong, please post on the forum post: https://forum.dokuwiki.org/thread/15736
