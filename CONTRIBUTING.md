# How to Contribute

This project is intended to bring desirable functionality to DokuWiki which is common place, or well known in WikiMedia. 

As it is worked on in downtime on the side, it can take some time to bring this functionality across, and all contributions are welcome!

I only request that you branch before contributing, to ensure that the master remains stable, and verified.

# Submitting Changes
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to dokuwiki-plugin-navbox](https://github.com/jovinjovinsson/dokuwiki-plugin-navbox/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done. Please provide evidence of testing the stability in at least the latest version of Dokuwiki, or even better, the last 4 versions for maximum compatibility.

# Coding Conventions

Rather than going for 'elegant' and 'least number of lines' I prefer to code in efficient, yet easily understandable code.

The purpose behind this is to maintain readability, and to assist newer developers to be able to decipher intent and contribute as well.

As such, try to avoid advanced functions that are lesser known, when a commonplace easy-to-read function could suffice. Also try to avoid ternary operators, and nesting ternary operators.
